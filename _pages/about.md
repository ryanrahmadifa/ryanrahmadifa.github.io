Ryan is excited to contribute by assisting projects in achieving state-of-the-art data-driven automated decision-making implementations for industries in Indonesia, while looking at applications of machine learning from a systems engineering perspective to maximize effectivity and efficiency.

Actively studying resources online regarding machine learning, looking forward to work on projects on the subject of computer vision, natural language processing, and other deep learning concepts. As an Industrial Engineering student with a deep interest in deep learning, he is more than open to discussions and opportunities of integrating those two subjects.

Experienced at working on data analytics, data science, and deep learning projects such as action recognition, image generation, and credit risk prediction. Actively reading scientific papers on machine learning and deep learning following the interest in industrial implementations of the field. 

This personal website serves as his portfolio presentation and the introduction of Ryan to others.
