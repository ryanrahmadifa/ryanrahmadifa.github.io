Leveraging NLP, the market research process was done significantly faster resulting in coherent and insightful results. NLP on the news data show that the EV industry has massive governmental support which coincides with the integrated mobility mode of MaaS developed by the government. With the general public supporting this ecosystem of integrated mobility, the best choice for an EV company is to work together with the Indonesian government to reduce carbon emission and make the mobility of the people electricity based.

Applications based on ride-hailing and ride-sharing business models are not only focused on the transportation aspect of mobility but also enabling other quality of life features such as food deliveries. Most users are concerned with said other features which might drive the developers to focus on making other customizable features, instead of focusing on mobility and its consequences toward the environment. Idea generation takes all that data a step further to give three alternatives for strategic plans and three MaaS packages for the management to discuss upon. By using state-of- the-art libraries for NLP and Python as a base for automation of every process in the pipeline, this essay has proven that an end-to-end automated market research pipeline is possible and has enormous potential for real-world use cases.
